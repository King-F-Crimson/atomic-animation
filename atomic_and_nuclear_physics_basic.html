                    <h3>Dalton billiard ball model (1803)</h3>

                    <p>Based on Dalton's atomic theory, the billiar ball model suggests that atoms cannot be divided or destroyed. This idea is based on Democritus's idea of atoms, which according to him atoms are physically indivisible thing that compose everything. During Dalton's time the subatomic particles (e.g. proton, electron, and neutron) are not discovered yet, so the model depicts atoms as solid with no internal structure.</p>

                    <h3>J. J. Thomson plum pudding model (1904)</h3>

                    <p>Thompson discovered the existance of electron through his electron discovery experiment. After his discovery, he proposed the idea that atoms are composed of electrons surrounded by "soup" or "cloud" of positive charge which balances the negative charge of electron.</p>

                    <h3>Rutherford model (1911)</h3>

                    <p>Through his gold foil experiment, Rutherford discovered the existance of a dense, positively charged nucleus inside atoms. He reached that conclusion by firing positively charged alpha particles at a thin gold foil. The result is most of the alpha particles are able to pass without getting deflected or only a small deflection, but a few of them got deflected at large angle. This leads to his conclussion that most of the atom is empty space with a positively charged core that contains most of its mass.</p>

                    <h3>Bohr model (1913)</h3>

                    <p>After Rutherford discovery of the dense positively charged core, Bohr modified Rutherford's atom model by suggesting that electrons moved around the nucleus of the atom in orbits with fixed radius and energy level, similar to how planets orbit the sun.</p>

                    <h3>Schrödinger quantum theory model (1926)</h3>

                    <p>Schrödinger's discovery states that electrons do not move at fixed orbit, instead they move in waves. The exact location of the electrons are unknown, but there are clouds of probability called orbitals in which the electrons are likely to be located.</p>
