                        <h3>Dalton billiard ball model (1803)</h3>

                        <p>Based on Dalton's atomic theory, the billiar ball model suggests that atoms cannot be divided or destroyed. During this time the subatomic particles (e.g. proton, electron, and neutron) are not discovered yet, so the model depicts atoms as solid with no internal structure.</p>

                        <h3>J. J. Thomson plum pudding model (1904)</h3>

                        <p>Thompson discovered the electron through his electron discovery experiment. His model suggests that electrons are spread in a positively charged sphere.</p>

                        <h3>Rutherford model (1911)</h3>

                        <p>Through his gold foil experiment, Rutherford discovered the existance of a dense, positively charged nucleus inside atoms. He believed that electrons go around the nucleus.</p>

                        <h3>Bohr model (1913)</h3>

                        <p>In Bohr's atomic model, electrons move around the nucleus in orbits at fixed size and energy level.</p>

                        <h3>Schrödinger quantum theory model (1926)</h3>

                        <p>Schrödinger's discovery states that electrons do not move at fixed orbit, instead they move in waves. The exact location of the electrons are unknown, but there are clouds of probability called orbitals in which the electrons are likely to be located.</p>
