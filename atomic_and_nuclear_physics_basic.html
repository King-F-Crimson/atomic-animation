                    <h3>Dalton billiard ball model (1803)</h3>

                    <p>Based on Dalton's atomic theory, the billiar ball model suggests that atoms cannot be divided or destroyed. This idea is based on Democritus's idea of atoms, which according to him atoms are physically indivisible thing that compose everything. During Dalton's time the subatomic particles (e.g. proton, electron, and neutron) are not discovered yet, so the model depicts atoms as solid with no internal structure.</p>

                    <p>The strength of this model is that it states that atoms of a same element have same property (chemically). However this model is still incorrect about atoms being indivisible, atoms are composed of subatomic particles like electrons, protons, and neutrons.</p>

                    <h3>J. J. Thomson plum pudding model (1904)</h3>

                    <p>Thompson discovered the existance of electron through his electron discovery experiment. After his discovery, he proposed the idea that atoms are composed of electrons surrounded by "soup" or "cloud" of positive charge which balances the negative charge of electron.</p>

                    <p>The strength of this model is that it recognizes that electrons are a component of atoms and found out that they are spread around the atom. However it does not have the positive part of the atom as the nucleus, instead it is portrayed as a positively charged "cloud".</p>

                    <h3>Rutherford's gold foil experiment</h3>

                    <p>This is the description of the gold foil experiment. It is currently empty so it is just a placeholder. Please continue reading the other text instead.</p>

                    <h3>Rutherford model (1911)</h3>

                    <p>Through his gold foil experiment, Rutherford discovered the existance of a dense, positively charged nucleus inside atoms. He reached that conclusion by firing positively charged alpha particles at a thin gold foil. The result is most of the alpha particles are able to pass without getting deflected or only a small deflection, but a few of them got deflected at large angle. This leads to his conclussion that most of the atom is empty space with a positively charged core that contains most of its mass.</p>

                    <p>The strength of this model is that it shows that the positive charge of atoms is located in the nucleus. However it doesn't explain about why and how electrons stay in orbit.</p>

                    <h3>Bohr model (1913)</h3>

                    <p>After Rutherford discovery of the dense positively charged core, Bohr modified Rutherford's atom model by suggesting that electrons moved around the nucleus of the atom in orbits with fixed radius and energy level, similar to how planets orbit the sun.</p>

                    <p>The strength of this model is that it proposed that electrons are orbiting the nucleus at an orbit with fixed radius and energy level. However electrons do not actually orbit the nucleus, because if they do it does not explain why they don't emit energy and eventually collapse into the atom nucleus, this model also does not work well with heavier atoms.</p>

                    <h3>Schrödinger quantum theory model (1926)</h3>

                    <p>Schrödinger's discovery states that electrons do not move at fixed orbit, instead they move in waves. The exact location of the electrons are unknown, but there are clouds of probability called orbitals in which the electrons are likely to be located.</p>

                    <p>The strength of this model is that it states that electrons do not orbit the atom nucleus, instead they exist in probability clouds where their location are likely to be with up to 95% accuracy. It is still widely accepted as the most accurate model of atom currently available.</p>
